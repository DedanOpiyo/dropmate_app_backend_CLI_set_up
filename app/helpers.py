# # ORM Requirements
# Property methods should be defined to add appropriate constraints to each model class.
# Each model class should include ORM methods (create, delete, get all, and find by id at minimum).


# # CLI Requirements
# For EACH class in the data model, the CLI must include options: to create an object, delete an object, display all objects, view related objects, and find an object by attribute.
# The CLI should validate user input and object creations/deletions, providing informative errors to the user.
# Imports are used in files only where necessary.

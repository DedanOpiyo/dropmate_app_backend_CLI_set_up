# shipments â€” borders inferred via route_locations
# To get all borders involved in a shipment, use:
# SELECT l.*
# FROM route_locations rl
# JOIN locations l ON rl.location_id = l.id
# WHERE rl.route_id = :route_id AND l.is_border = true;

# here: Shipment links to route, derives border crossings from route locations.


# Display full hierarchy of a location: recursive query on parent_id || You can use recursive queries on locations.parent_id to trace full hierarchies.
# Trace if a shipment crosses a border: match shipment route locations with is_border = true
